# üìö Fingerprint-Based Student Attendance System

A biometric student attendance tracking system using fingerprint recognition and IoT technology. Developed as a final year diploma project in Computer Engineering and Mechatronics at the University of Economy in Bydgoszcz.

## üéØ Project Overview

Traditional attendance methods are often inefficient, error-prone, and vulnerable to manipulation. This system leverages fingerprint biometrics and a Raspberry Pi to automate and secure the attendance process in educational institutions.

## üîß Features

- ‚úÖ Fingerprint enrollment & verification
- üïí Real-time attendance logging with timestamps
- üìä Attendance reporting and analytics
- üîí Secure biometric data storage
- üåê Web interface built with Flask & JavaScript
- üìÅ Export functionality to CSV and PDF

## üõ† Technologies Used

- **Hardware**: Raspberry Pi 4, Optical Fingerprint Sensor
- **Software**: Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Database**: Local storage (mock DB with future potential for SQL/CSV)
- **Networking**: HTTP/HTTPS communication

## üß± System Architecture

- **Client Side**: Fingerprint sensor, HTML/JS interface
- **Server Side**: Raspberry Pi running Flask API
- **Communication**: Fetch API for asynchronous HTTP requests

## üìà Results

- üîç High accuracy in authenticating enrolled students
- ‚ö° Quick and seamless attendance logging
- üö´ Eliminated proxy attendance
- üß™ Thoroughly tested for reliability and usability

## ‚öôÔ∏è Future Improvements

- üì± Android app integration
- üîå Offline attendance caching
- üîã Power backup for Raspberry Pi
- üíæ Switch to SQL database for better scalability
